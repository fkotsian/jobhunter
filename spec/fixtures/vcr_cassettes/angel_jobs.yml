        happiness at Crew is 7 days a week. We have members in 32 countries and we
        have a goal of replying to all emails within an hour. We''re not quite there
        yet but we''re working ''round the clock to get there.\n\nEvery interaction
        we have with our customers, whether it comes from our product or one of our
        customers, is should feel like a ''wow moment.''\n\nThis is why we think our
        Happiness Team is so important.\n\nAlthough we don''t work set hours at Crew,
        customer happiness is one of the parts of our company where the demands of
        the position require operating on somewhat of a schedule.\n\nCurrently our
        Happiness Team has been covering all happiness, every day of the week but
        we know that''s not sustainable long-term. We want to give our customers the
        best support possible but at the same time we don''t think anyone should be
        working 7 days a week or feel stress from work on days they decide to take
        off.\n\nThat''s why we''re looking to welcome a member to our Happiness Team
        who''s schedule is flexible enough to help take care of members on weekends.\n\nThe
        day-to-day of this position is the same as the Happiness Concierge position
        and is full-time. Everything you''re doing will be similar, but the one exception
        is your schedule will be shifted a few days to help cover weekends.\n\nEvery
        day we get to chat, tweet, and exchange messages with innovative people and
        some of the most talented creative professionals in the world.\n\nWe\u2019re
        looking for someone to work with us to help our members have a memorable experience
        using Crew every day, not just Monday through Friday.","created_at":"2015-04-19T20:17:54Z","updated_at":"2015-04-19T20:28:45Z","equity_cliff":"1.0","equity_min":"0.1","equity_max":"0.2","equity_vest":"4.0","currency_code":"USD","job_type":"full-time","salary_min":40000,"salary_max":65000,"angellist_url":"https://angel.co/crew/jobs/62339-weekend-happiness-concierge","tags":[{"id":23977,"tag_type":"SkillTag","name":"customer

        I\u2019m looking for a partner to work alongside me this summer to build our
        growth engine. We have customers, but it\u2019s time to accelerate.\n\n#Why
        this might be interesting\nUntil now we\u2019ve done little marketing, so
        the next few months will be a series of strategic initiatives and experiments
        that we\u2019ll develop. You\u2019ll work on narrative, partnerships, paid
        search, business development, SEO, content, customer service, new product
        & anything else that helps acquire and retain customers. You\u2019ll be talking
        to lots of startup founders, CEOs, CFOs, VCs, angel investors, accountants
        and lawyers.\n\n#Why this might not be interesting\nI believe in being methodical,
        and in the scientific method. We\u2019re deploying investor capital; measurement
        is critical so you must be comfortable with analytics tools and basic statistical
        analysis. We\u2019ll be managing many concurrent initiatives, and I often
        work long hours. For us to collaborate effectively, I expect the same effort
        from you. There will be no checklist to work from; instead you will plan,
        execute and own many projects with my support.\n\nThis internship is paid.","created_at":"2015-04-19T19:42:54Z","updated_at":"2015-04-19T19:55:08Z","equity_cliff":"1.0","equity_min":"0.0","equity_max":"0.0","equity_vest":"4.0","currency_code":"USD","job_type":"internship","salary_min":0,"salary_max":0,"angellist_url":"https://angel.co/sharewave-1/jobs/62336-growth-intern","tags":[{"id":15731,"tag_type":"SkillTag","name":"data

        on the music industry by introducing a disruptive innovation. We will work
        together to specify, design, and build our first product, SING. Your skill

        is a venture-backed start-up that provides an online platform helping students
        rent rooms to and from each other while they go abroad for an internship or
        study abroad semester. Universities sign up to this platform so that their
        students can use it for free. Universities gain an extra tool to increase
        their supply of off-campus housing and students have a platform to find and
        rent out rooms when they are going abroad.\n\nCompleting a second investment
        round enables us to extend our service. In the coming year, we will develop
        a payments service that solves the problem of distrust in cross-border and
        faceless payments. HousingAnywhere.com is going to act as a third party custodian
        in order to prevent students from being scammed. Developing this functionality
        is our next target and in order to achieve this, we need the help of skillful
        developers to develop a solid, conversion-oriented product.","high_concept":"The
